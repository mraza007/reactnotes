### React Forms
- In HTML form elements such as `<input>` ,`<textarea>` and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update based on user input.
- In React , mutable state is kept in the state of components,and only updated with `setState()`.
- How do we use React to control form input state?
- React Controls
  - What is shown 
  - What happens the user types.
- Input elements controlled in this way are called **"controlled components"**.
